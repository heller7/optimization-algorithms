# optimization-algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various optimization algorithms for different Operations Research problems.

## Implementations

### TSP

The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each node exactly once and returns to the origin node.

- **Exact Method**: Mixed Integer Programming implementation using Gurobi
  - Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) formulation for subtour elimination
  - CSV-based instance import
  - NetworkX graph representation
- **Location**: `/tsp`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Gurobi 10.0+
- NetworkX 3.1+
- Pandas 1.5+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optimization-algorithms.git        
   ```
