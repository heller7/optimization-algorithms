# optimization-algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various optimization algorithms for different Operations Research problems.

## Implementations

### TSP

The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each node exactly once and returns to the origin node.

- **Exact Method**: Mixed Integer Programming implementation using Gurobi
  - Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) formulation for subtour elimination
  - CSV-based instance import
  - NetworkX graph representation
- **Location**: `/tsp`

### Matching
A matching is a subset of the edge set of a graph where each node is incident to at most one edge of the chosen subset. A classic optimization problem is to find a maximum matching, i.e. a subset with as many edges as possible (not to be confused with a maximal matching!).

- **IP-Formulation**: Integer Programming implementation using Gurobi.
- **Location**: `/matching`
